Python has two basic modes: script and interactive. 
  1. Script Mode, is used when the user is working with more than one single code or a block of code. 
   Script mode is where you put a bunch of commands into a file (a script), and then tell Python to run the file. 
  2. Interactive mode is used when an user wants to run one single line or one block of code.
   Interactive mode is where you type commands and they are immediately executed.
